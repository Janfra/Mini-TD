# Mini-TD
I have decided to try out a new approach to my mini projects. I will outline goals directly in this repository. This project I will continue exploring Godot, focusing on experimenting with my first tower defense game.

### Plan Description
Mini TD will be a project that I will divide in sections with separate goals. Starting with be a very small in scope focusing mostly on just exploring common tower defense mechanics, later sections focusing on expanding it to an actual game. I may or may not complete all sections.

## Section one: Preparing 
#### Create a simple map
- [X] Create a grid
- [X] Populate grid with simple squared objects

#### Simple path
- [X] Grid includes a path for enemies to follow

#### Basic placing
- [X] Grid cells can be used to place a base placeable object

## Section two: Basic TD Mechanics
#### Expand path
- [X] Have test objects follow path

#### Enemy Waves
- [X] Can create and configure the enemy spawning waves
- [X] Spawn enemies as per their configuration

#### Enemy detection
- [ ] Placeable objects can include a component that detects objects in path
